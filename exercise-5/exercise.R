# Exercise 5: Gates Foundation Educational Grants

# Read data into a variable called `grants` using the `read.csv` function
grants <- read.csv('data/gates_money.csv')

# Use the View function to look at your data
View(grants)

# Create a variable `spending` as the `total_amount` column of the dataset
spending <- grants$total_amount

# Confirm that your `spending` variable is a vector using the `is.vector` function


# Create a variable `org` as the `organization` column of the dataset.

# Unfortunately, it will not be a vector by default, so you must transform it using the as.vector function
org <- as.vector(grants$organization)

### Now you can ask some more interesting questions about the dataset.  Store your answers in variables ###

# What was the mean grant value?
mean.spending <- mean(spending)

# What was the dollar amount of the largest grant?
highest.amount <- max(spending)

# What was the dollar amount of the smallest grant?
lowest.amount <- min(spending)

# Which organization received the largest grant?
largest.recipient <- org[spending == highest.amount]

# Which organization received the smallest grant?
smallest.recipient <- org[spending == lowest.amount]

# How many grants were awarded in 2010?
length(spending)
